- All analysis runs in isolated Docker/Firecracker sandboxes
- Network access is disabled by default
- Fork environments require explicit user authorization and RPC keys
- Code never leaves the isolated runner

### Privacy

- Contract code is encrypted at rest (KMS)
- Artifacts are signed and hashed for provenance verification
- No code is shared with third parties without explicit consent

### Monitoring

- All actions are logged for audit purposes (PII excluded)
- Metrics and tracing via Prometheus and OpenTelemetry
- Automated detection of unauthorized on-chain targets
