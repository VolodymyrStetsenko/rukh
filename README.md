> 
> ## 🚀 Your Ultimate Tool for Smart Contract Security
> 
> **RUKH** is a comprehensive, AI-powered platform designed for professional smart contract auditors, bug bounty hunters, and CTF players. It automates the entire audit workflow, from initial analysis to exploit generation, enabling you to find more vulnerabilities, faster.
> 
> 
> ## 🌟 Key Features
> 
> -   **Automated Vulnerability Detection:** Integrates industry-leading tools like Slither, Foundry, and Echidna to automatically identify a wide range of vulnerabilities.
> -   **AI-Powered Test Generation:** Uses advanced AI to automatically generate Foundry test cases and proof-of-concept exploits for identified vulnerabilities.
> -   **Comprehensive PoC Library:** Includes a library of production-ready exploit templates for common vulnerabilities like reentrancy, flash loan attacks, and access control issues.
> -   **CTF & Code4rena Workflow:** Provides a streamlined workflow for participating in competitive audits, from initial analysis to report submission.
> -   **Professional Reporting:** Generates detailed, professional-grade audit reports in Markdown and JSON formats.
> -   **CLI for Power Users:** A powerful command-line interface (CLI) for rapid analysis and automation.
> 
> ## ⚡ Quick Start: Your First Audit
> 
> Follow these steps to perform your first audit with RUKH.
> 
> ### 1. Installation
> 
> First, install the necessary dependencies.
> 
> ```bash
> # Install Foundry (Ethereum development toolkit)
> curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash && source ~/.bashrc && foundryup
> 
> # Install Slither (static analysis tool)
> pip3 install slither-analyzer --break-system-packages
> 
> # Install Node.js dependencies for CLI
> # (Assuming you are in the root of the rukh project)
> cd packages/client-js
> pnpm install
> pnpm build
> ```
> 
> ### 2. Run Analysis
> 
> Use the `rukh` CLI to analyze a smart contract. We'll use the provided demo contract.
> 
> ```bash
> # Navigate to the CLI directory
> # (Assuming you are in the root of the rukh project)
> cd packages/client-js
> 
> # Make the CLI executable
> chmod +x ./dist/rukh-cli.js
>
> # Run analysis on the demo contract
> ./dist/rukh-cli.js analyze ../../integrations/foundry/src/ReentrancyVault.sol
> ```
> 
> This will:
> 1.  Run Slither to find vulnerabilities.
> 2.  Generate Foundry tests for each vulnerability.
> 3.  Run the generated tests.
> 4.  Create a professional audit report in `./rukh-output/`.
> 
> ### 3. Review Results
> 
> Open the generated report to see the findings:
> 
> ```bash
> cat ./rukh-output/REPORT.md
> ```
> 
> You will also find generated test files and Slither's raw output in the `rukh-output` directory.
> 
> ## 🎯 CTF & Code4rena Workflow
> 
> Use this workflow to dominate competitive audits.
> 
> ### Step 1: Analyze the Target
> 
> ```bash
> # Clone the audit repository
> git clone <audit-repo-url>
> cd <audit-repo>
> 
> # Run RUKH analysis
> # Make sure to adjust the path to the rukh CLI
> /path/to/rukh/packages/client-js/dist/rukh-cli.js analyze src/Contract.sol
> ```
> 
> ### Step 2: Generate Exploits
> 
> Use the `exploit-generator` to automatically create PoC exploits from Slither's findings.
> 
> ```bash
> # Run the exploit generator
> python /path/to/rukh/tools/exploit-generator/exploit_generator.py \
>   rukh-output/slither-results.json \
>   Contract \
>   src/Contract.sol \
>   test/exploits/
> ```
> 
> ### Step 3: Customize & Test
> 
> Open the generated exploit files in `test/exploits/` and customize the attack logic. Then, run the tests to verify your exploit.
> 
> ```bash
> forge test --match-path test/exploits/*.sol -vvvv
> ```
> 
> ### Step 4: Submit Your Finding
> 
> Use the generated PoC and report to create a high-quality submission for the audit contest.
> 
> ## 📚 PoC Template Library
> 
> RUKH includes a library of pre-built exploit templates for common vulnerabilities. You can find them in `templates/poc-library/`.
> 
> **Available Templates:**
> -   Reentrancy
> -   Flash Loan Attacks
> -   Access Control
> 
> To use a template:
> 1.  Copy the template to your test directory.
> 2.  Update the contract interface.
> 3.  Implement the specific attack logic.
> 4.  Run the test with Foundry.
